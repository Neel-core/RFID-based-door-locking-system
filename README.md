# RFID-based-door-locking-system
This project is about to make a door locking system using a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), l2C LCD display, LED, buzzer, 4x4 matrix keypad, and an Arduino UNO. So, the user will have to first scan the right tag and then he will have to enter the correct password to unlock the door, if incorrect password was entered the access will be denied.
